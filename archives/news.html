	<p>We have historically updated our homepage with news every few days or so. Here, we will store all past updates we still have available. And on this new site powered by HTML and CSS directly, we can display the messages with the fonts utilized at the time.</p>
	
	<p>Recent as of Sunday, May 20, 2018 - This summer is a very special summer. Throughout the entirety of the next three months, we have four major fifth anniversaries in the form of the fifth anniversary of the server launching on June 24 followed by the original three videos.<br /><br />But there is another, far bigger anniversary awaiting us at the end of the summer. August 24, 2018 will mark ten years since Sean came walking down the hallway at the right time to watch a commercial advertising the merger of Verizon and Alltel, which led to the creation of Blue Cove and later Nosiphus. It's the tenth anniversary of the founding of this organization.<br /><br />As part of the N10 summer, we will be obviously transitioning from Minecraft 1.7.10 to 1.12.2 as part of the updates to Telkit, but we will also be working on the newly revived and enriched designs we've come up with, notably Saturn and nDesk, and perhaps other ideas once they come rolling into the environment.<br /><br />We plan to release footage in our archives to the YouTube channel, as well as bring back legacy content in new productions. Ideas are being negotiated about the possible return of Nosiphus Nightly News with Sean Crain, and perhaps some of the other NTS-era programs. It may even be possible for Sean to dig out the old Mario plushes and record MBC Mushroom News with Mario again for some reason.</p>
