	<p>From Nosiphus World Headquarters in Midton, this is <i>Nosiphus Nightly News with Sean Crain.</i></p>
	
	<p>From February 28 to September 13 of 2015, those words or a variation of them were uttered at the start of every video we made. They were meant to make the Recent as of posts obsolete, and during that time period, they did.</p>
	
	<p>A lot of things have changed since the last time Sean Crain anchored the newscast. Nosiphus went through an expansionist phase followed by a sharp retraction of that, a communications platform shift, not to mention the countless personal things that happened for each of us.</p>
	
	<p>Two of those things were Jackson James and Zack Carter joining Nosiphus in December 2016 and July 2017. They began pushing for <i>Nosiphus Nightly News</i> to return. While it is not confirmed yet, Sean definitely sees the news as coming back, albeit likely in a weekly format.</p>
