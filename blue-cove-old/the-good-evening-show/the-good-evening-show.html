	<p>Aside from <em>Nosiphus Nightly News</em>, the only other show that was ever recorded and uploaded was <em>The Good Evening Show with Maguire Rodgers</em>. Because of the departure of Maguire Rodgers on July 14, 2018, the show, if it does return, will not have him as host. Sean may pick the show up himself, but that it is unlikely.</p>
