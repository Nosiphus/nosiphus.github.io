	<p>Aside from <i>Nosiphus Nightly News</i>, the only other show that was ever recorded and uploaded was <i>The Good Evening Show with Maguire Rodgers</i>. While the original footage was taken down due to copyright reasons and is lost forever, we may well begin production on this show once again, Maguire Rodgers has confirmed that if the series returns, he will resume hosting the program.</p>
