		 		<p>Hi, I'm Earl, and such. I was born on June 9, 1969, and I sexually identify as the air you breathe. I can't provide a photo of myself, since I'm literally air, so you'll have to settle for this photo I took.</p>
		 		<p>As for my personal life, well, I'm homeless so I'm gay. I still live with my parents who are also homeless. We have a good time eatin' raccoon and such. My parents named me Earl after my grandad Earl Bon Jones. I am a air so I float through outer space and such. So meh I don't carewoaergvuizsdghfauioguaweiug...sorry I have dyslexia. uh bi-sexual.</p>

		<p>My only criticism of the Nosiphus site is that Sean needs to add some a 'dem pretty pictures of raccoons, and such.<br><br><strong><u>The Story</u></strong><br>While goofing off in class one day, Jason and Sean filled in a Nosiphus membership form with whatever random concept they could come up with. What resulted was Jason's new mascot, Earl.</p>
		<p>Starting from October 27, 2018, <a href="/nosiphites/jason-faucett/jason-faucett.html">Jason Faucett</a> portrays Earl.</p>
