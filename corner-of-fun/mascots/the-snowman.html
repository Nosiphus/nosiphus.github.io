					This is the face of a man who has been stuck in the depression stage of the Cycle of Grief.<br>
					The Snowman has seen things that no man should ever be subjected to.<br>
					He often attempts to find the nearest noose he can, but he melts through the rope.<br><br>
					
					His favorite drink is bleach.<br><br><br>
					
					
					The Snowman gets together with Eskimo Jesus every weekend to play card games. The Snowman correctly suspects that Eskimo Jesus cheats by using his godly powers to see the Snowman's cards, which is why the Snowman is dirt poor. EJ has also made the Snowman immortal, much to the Snowman's dismay.<br><br>
					
					He is so poor that he goes to KFC and licks the other people's fingers. He is so poor that he chases the garbage truck with a shopping list. He is so poort that-well, you get the jist.<br><br>
					
					Oddly enough, the Snowman is content during the Christmas season, and is always very upbeat and happy. He loves to hear the laughter of the happy children. But from Boxing Day until Black Friday, he can't be bothered. For most of the year, he wanders the street listening for children's screams to fuel his sadness. He is a seriously disturbed Snowman.<br><br>
					
					The Snowman has lived a long life, and, thanks to Eskimo Jesus, is immortal. This is terrible for him, because it means that he will never be able to finally do the thing he's been wishing for since 10,000 BC: die. All he can do is wander these lonely roads listening to children's cries and Simon and Garfunkel's <i>The Sounds of Silence</i>.

					<b>The Story</b><br><br>
					The Snowman was constructed by Sean in his grandmother's yard on February 3, 2010. This means that the Snowman is the oldest Nosiphus asset in existence, excluding only early brand names.<br><br>
					The Snowman was rediscovered on January 20, 2017, when Sean and the newly-joined Jake were viewing some of Sean's old photos, and they came across an image of 8-year-old Sean standing behind the Snowman. The appearance of the Snowman's face looked very neutral, like it had seen something that no one should ever have to see.<br><br>
					Since January 21, 2017, <a href="/nosiphites/jake-brannon.html">Jake Brannon</a> has portrayed the Snowman.
