	<p>Eskimo Jesus and he have card matches every Saturday. The Snowman believes, rightly, that Eskimo Jesus cheats by using his godly powers to see his cards. That's why he's dirt poor.<br /><br />He is so poor he goes to KFC and licks other people's fingers. He is so poor that he goes to KFC and licks other people's fingers. He is so poor that he chases the garbage truck with a shopping list. He is so poor that-well, you get the jist.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the Snowman is content during the Christmas season, and is always very upbeat and happy. He loves to hear the laughter of the happy and upset children. But from Boxing Day until Black Friday, he couldn't be bothered. During those days, he wanders the street, listening for children's screams to fuel his sadness. He is a seriously disturbed Snowman.<br /><br />The Snowman has lived a long life, and unfortunately is immortal. This is terrible for him, because this means that he will never be able to finally do the thing he's been wishing for since 10,000 BC: die. All he can do is wander these lonely streets listening to children's cries and listen to Simon and Garfunkel's <i>The Sounds of Silence.</i><br /><br /><b><u>The Story</u></b><br />The snowman was constructed by Sean in his grandmother's yard on February 3, 2010. This means that the Snowman is the oldest Nosiphus asset in existence, excluding only the Blue Cove brand name and some of our very earliest projects.<br /><br />The Snowman was rediscovered on January 20, 2017, when Sean and the recently-joined Jake were viewing some of Sean's old Facebook photos. That is actually 8-year-old Sean standing behind the snowman. The appearance of the Snowman's face looked very neutral, like it had seen something that no one should ever have to see.<br /><br /><a href="/nosiphites/jacob-brannon/jacob-brannon.html">Jacob Brannon</a> portrays The Snowman.<br /><br /><b><u>Photos</u></b><br /><img src="/corner-of-fun/mascots/the-snowman/photo.png" alt="The Snowman after creation, February 3, 2010" style="width: 75%"></p>
