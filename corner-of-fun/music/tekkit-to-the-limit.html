					<b>Tekkit To The Limit</b><br>
					by <a href="/nosiphites/sean-crain.html">Sean Crain</a><br>
					Written in April 2015<br>
					A parody of Take It To The Limit by the Eagles<br><br><br>
					
					Searching all over for some rubber trees<br>
					When the sunlight has faded to moon<br>
					I was hoping for some saplings that I needed<br>
					Once in a blue moon<br><br>
					
					You know I've always been a miner<br>
					(spend my nights digging down)<br>
					And it's too dark to see<br>
					(can't seem to turn around)<br>
					But the caves I've seen lately<br>
					Keep on digging out, and mining out, and digging out the same<br><br>
					
					So give me some copper<br>
					And don't let me die<br>
					And Tekkit to the Limit one more time<br><br>
					
					You can spend all your ores on BuildCraft<br>
					You can use all your stuff for IC2<br>
					If RedPower crashed the server tomorrow<br>
					Would you use EE2?<br><br>
					
					And when you're looking for some diamonds<br>
					(All of us have been there)<br>
					And it's getting too cold<br>
					(Seems the mine is all but bare)<br>
					When there's nothing worth mining<br>
					Still you keep searching, search constantly<br>
					You keep searching for gold<br><br>
					
					So give me some copper<br>
					And don't let me die<br>
					And Tekkit to the Limit one more time<br><br>
					
					Tekkit to the Limit<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit one more time<br><br>
					
					Tekkit to the Limit (whee-eee)<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit (come on and)<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit one more time<br><br>
					
					Tekkit to the Limit (whee-eee)<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit (uranium) <br>
					Tekkit to the Limit one more time (aaaaaaaaah)<br>
					
					Tekkit to the Limit<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit one more time<br><br>
					
					Tekkit to the Limit (please)<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit (come on and)<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit one more time<br><br>
					
					Tekkit to the Limit (aaah)<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit (AAAAH)<br>
					Tekkit to the Limit one more time
