	<p><b><u>A Conversation Consisting of Beatles #1s:</u></b><br />Billy Shears: <b>Hey Jude</b>, <b>Eleanor Rigby</b> had <b>Something</b> to say to you.<br />Jude: She wants us to <b>Come Together</b> and <b>Get Back</b> with each other? <b>I Feel Fine</b> on my own.<br />Billy Shears: I talked to her just <b>Yesterday</b>. <b>She Loves You.</b><br />Jude: I don't know about that. I went down <b>The Long and Winding Road</b> with her. I had <b>A Hard Day's Night Eight Days A Week</b>. I guess <b>We Can Work It Out</b> if we try.<br /><b>From Me To You</b>, she's a lot better person than <b>Lady Madonna</b>. That woman is a <b>Day Tripper</b>.<br />Jude: No arguing about that, she's had her <b>Ticket To Ride</b> for a long time. She may try to buy me a lot things, but she <b>Can't Buy Me Love</b>.<br />Billy Shears: Hey, <b>All You Need Is Love</b>. So, what've you been up to?<br />Jude: Well, I haven't told many people yet, but <b>Let It Be</b> known that I am now a <b>Paperback Writer.</b><br />Billy Shears: Didn't you write that story about the <b>Yellow Submarine</b>?<br />Jude: Yes, that was me. I actually bought a new office on <b>Penny Lane</b>. I could use some <b>Help</b> moving in.<br />Billy Shears: This place has some potential, although it is old. Well, I'll be off, I have some things to take care of.<br />Eleanor: Jude?<br />Jude: <b>Hello, Goodbye.</b> What brings you this way, Eleanor?<br />Eleanor: Well, I've just been thinking about things, and all day, I've realized that <b>I Want To Hold Your Hand</b>.<br />Can you find room in your heart for me?<br />Jude: Of course I can. <b>Love Me Do</b>.<br />Eleanor: I overheard your conversation with Billy. You know, I think you could call something <b>The Ballad of John and Yoko</b>.<br />Jude: Interesting title, I'll have to see what I can do with it.</p>
