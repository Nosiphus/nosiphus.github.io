	<p><b>Saturn</b><br /> <br />Q: What is Saturn?<br /><b>A: Saturn is an operating system. It was conceived in 2011 as a concept system, but has only ever existed in the computer world as a customized openSUSE Linux distribution. We plan to write the operating system from the ground up.</b><br /> <br />Q: What is Saturn's primary focus?<br /><b>A: In the long run, our intention is for Saturn to be an entirely new codebase free of ancient jargon. The trobule with macOS is that it's not customizable, Windows is plagued by security problems and ancient compatiblity features, and if you don't know what you're doing you really shouldn't be using Linux.</b></p>
