			<p>Recent as of Monday, November 18, 2019 - Nosiphus is a small organization that consists of a group of friends that like to make <em>Minecraft</em> videos, and we do not have ads running on these videos. We cannot afford a fine of any size, and with the looming threat of the FTC fining YouTubers of all shapes and sizes up to $42,000 per video, Sean has made the decision to private every video on the channel.<br><br>We urge you to sign the change.org petition and comment on the FTC's website about this.<br><br><a href="https://www.change.org/p/youtubers-and-viewers-unite-against-ftc-regulation">https://www.change.org/p/youtubers-and-viewers-unite-against-ftc-regulation</a><br><br><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=FTC-2019-0054-0001">https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=FTC-2019-0054-0001</a> - comment period open until December 9, 2019.</p>
			
			
			
			<p>On December 12, 2019, the United Kingdom will hold a general election that could shape the path of Britain forever. For the first time in decades, the choices are between a Conservative Party that has been captured by the hard-right, one that is hell-bent on dragging Britain down the road of nationalist sentiment and driving a wedge between the UK and the European Union, and a truly left-wing Labour Party that could turn the UK away from the Thatcherite road that has led to so much discontentment in pain in Britain.<br><br>If you live in Britain, we urge you to get to the polls and vote <span class="red">Labour</span>.</p>
