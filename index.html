			<p>Recent as of Sunday, November 10, 2019 - On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, 1918, Europe breathed a sigh of relief as the Great War ended. Twenty years later, an even greater conflict left the world in ruins.<br><br>November is often overlooked in the holiday season because of Christmas and the relative lack of importance of Thanksgiving. This is one of the most worrying mistakes we make as a world. November 11 represents something far more important than any other holiday does: the costs of nationalism and war.<br><br>In recent years, nationalist tendencies have flared up across both the United States and Europe. The rise of the far-right should be utterly condemned and absolutely offensive to any decent person alive. Seventy years of peace in Europe have only been possible because of international cooperation and a shared sense of remembrance of just how catastrophic that not just the world wars, but all wars, have been.<br><br>Armistice Day and Veteran's Day are the two most common names for this holiday. There exists, however, a third: Rememberance Day. A day to pause and reflect on how bad these wars were and how humans must never allow their most base instinicts to do such horrendous things ever again.</p>
			<p>On December 12, 2019, the United Kingdom will hold a general election that could shape the path of Britain forever. For the first time in decades, the choices are between a Conservative Party that has been captured by the hard-right, one that is hell-bent on dragging Britain down the road of nationalist sentiment and driving a wedge between the UK and the European Union, and a truly left-wing Labour Party that could turn the UK away from the Thatcherite road that has led to so much discontentment in pain in Britain.<br><br>If you live in Britain, we urge you to get to the polls and vote <span class="red">Labour</span>.</p>
