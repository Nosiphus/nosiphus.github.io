	  <p>Recent as of Tuesday, September 11, 2018 - We uploaded an episode of <em>Nosiphus Nightly News with Sean Crain</em> today, and in it, Sean discussed the plan for the layout of how <em>Lunatics</em> will be when it airs, in addition to what incoming members of Nosiphus plan to do. If all things go as currently planned, Lunatics will debut live this Friday or Saturday, although we do not have a set time yet. Drake Fischer is currently working on a new logo for Lunatics to replace the one we've been using since 2015.</p>
      <p>But as welcoming the new era of Nosiphus brings in excitement, we also must bid adieu to the era we leave. After being with us for over five years, Wyatt Mote resigned from Nosiphus today. His departure truly does signal the end of the 2013 consensus that held this company together for five years and really got things going in a positive direction. We wish him well in whatever he decides to do in life, and we thank him for his contributions.</p>
      <p>And, from me, on a personal note, you've been an excellent friend to me in the years since we met, and I have considered you my closest friend in that time. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, because this organization is as much yours as it is mine, and it never could've gotten to where it is today without your help. I love ya, man, no homo.<br> - Sean Crain - </p>
