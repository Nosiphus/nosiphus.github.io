  <p>Recent as of Sunday, November 25, 2018 - This is the first news update we've posted in a couple weeks, and there is a lot to talk about.</p>
  <p>1. Reconstruction - Over the last week, a massive rebuilding has been underway on the Telkit server that has never been done before. Buildings from various periods in Nosiphus history, including buildings that have never been copied to a new world, are appearing on the new server for the first time. So far, this has included: Cherry and Maddie's Hotel, Sean's European Manor, the clock tower atop Parliament, Nate's Complex, and one of Nate's old houses. We will be expanding on this in the weeks to come.</p>
  <p>2. Nosiphus HQ - The plan listed on the Nosiphus Archives has been outdated for a few months now, and we've finally gotten around to updating it. The campus now has a proper name, N2, and it has undergone some big changes. First, the hotel and cafe are no more. As much as we want to include them, it's impossible with the amount of space we have. Second, the spots that the hotel and cafe were on have merged, and in that spot now sits the Nosiphus Presentation Theater, primarily used for delivering keynotes and updates, although it can be used as a cinema. We are planning to rename it to the Wyatt D. Mote Presentation Theater, in honor of our most important former member. Thirdly, the offices have moved from the western side of the front building to the third floor of the research and development building. It gives us far more space to put proper offices.</p>
  <p>3. Role Changes - Sean has appointed Charles Routh to be in charge of the political commentary department, and will be shaking up some other positions in the days to come.</p>
  <p>Thank you. </p>
