  			<p>Recent as of Sunday, August 4, 2019 - These last couple of days have been very tragic. El Paso and Dayton occurred within 24 hours of one another. Alongside the other tragedies that have happened throughout this year, they prove that we as a nation have not done anything to prevent this kind of senseless violence. Congress must act to pass H.R. 8 at the least, but much more is needed to combat this epidemic, and among that is a wider look at our culture of glorifying war and violence.<br><br>Thoughts and prayers are not enough. More is needed. People often complain there is a rush to politicize these issues. The problem is that everyone who says that, generally in right-wing circles, tend to say that to try and delay the debate forever so nothing ever happens. The United States, as with many other issues, cannot continue to be the one outlier among industrialized nations. This is not a problem even in Switzerland, where gun ownership is high. Australia confiscated weapons in 1996 after Port Arthur, facing hellacious backlash, but it worked in virtually eliminating the mass shooting problem. We must follow in their footsteps.<br><br>We have decided that now would be an appropriate time to restore the Love project, founded after similar tragedies in late 2017.</p>
