	  <p>Recent as of Friday, August 24, 2018 - Today is the most special day in our history ever. Today, August 24, 2018, is the tenth anniversary of our founding. I never expected this day to get here, and if you had asked me just a mere six years ago whether anything major would come out of the five years since the relaunch, I could not have possibly said yes. And yet here we are, ten years after the moment I walked into the living room and saw that Verizon/Alltel merger advertisment.<br>
	    <br>
	    Here we are, with countless brand names, ideas, and product concepts, among these being Blue Cove, Red Phones, HandPaw, Pink Beach, SCT, Nosiphus itself, Olivia Jones, WalStar, Sanders &amp; Higgs, Sanders &amp; Hendricks, SeanNet, SeaNET, Crogan, Saturn, Voyager, Professional, Telkit, NosPack, Love, and the countless others.<br>
	    <br>
	    I could not have forseen the launching of a Minecraft server that led to Nosiphus having international name recognition, nor could I have forseen the memories that I would have, especially in the last five years. Nosiphus has truly defined who I am for ten years, I can't imagine what things would be like without it.<br>
	    <br>
	    To everyone who's been involved in Nosiphus, present and past, I extend a thank you for helping to build this organization into what it is now. I especially thank Wyatt Mote and former member Maguire Rodgers, the two guys who contributed the most into shaping this company into what it is now. I couldn't have done it without you two.<br>
	    <br>
	    Thank you all for making it happen.<br>
	    <br>
	    - Sean Crain -<br>
	    P.S. This was typed on August 23, but I placed it under the August 24 date since we plan on including this post in near-future projects.<br>
