			<p>Recent as of Tuesday, November 19, 2019 - We have made all of our videos on the channel public again. We have added rationale disclaimers to each video description that state why we have classified each video as either made for kids or not made for kids. Our current policy is that each video is to have this disclaimer, and a standard set of disclaimers will be available soon. If the FTC listens and doesn't go through with this, then we will keep these disclaimers anyway, but if they do, we still plan to re-private the channel to protect ourselves from fines until we see what's happened.</p>
