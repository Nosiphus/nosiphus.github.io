	  <p>Recent as of Wednesday, July 25, 2018 - We are making some changes to the way we operate here.</p>
	  <p> <strong>1. Modpacks</strong> - Our modpacks have been made private due to OptiFine's modpack rules. We want to write a custom launcher which would allow us to open the monetized link OptiFine uses, but we've no clue where to start. We want it to look similar to the early 2012 Technic Pack launcher, and it would have all of our modpacks available. We are working on conversions to the connected texture system and republicizing packs after OptiFine is removed.</p>
	  <p>
			<strong>2. Members</strong> - Both Maguire Rodgers and Nathan Brandon have resigned. While this was expected, things are really starting to move back to the Sean and Wyatt duo on the Minecraft server, something that really hasn't happened in years. Wyatt always wanted the server to be private and was against the move to make it publically accessible, so we may consider reprivatizing the server and enforcing a whitelist once again.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. YouTube</strong> - We still have the remainder of Castaways to release. Sean is likely going to release the entirety of the six-hour session in one video.
