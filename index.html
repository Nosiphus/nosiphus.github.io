	  <p>Recent as of Sunday, September 9, 2018 - It's become clear that the old model that held up Nosiphus since December 2, 2012, which was centered around software design and video games is beginning to collapse, as our childhoods come to a close. However, as these change, a new era is starting to open, one focused around political and religious conversations coming from a progressive, secular angle. There are four new Discord server invitees from the Let's Talk Elections Discord server, who will become pivotal as Nosiphus reshapes itself into this new direction.</p>
	  <p>You can notice that the last two uploaded videos have only used Minecraft to record in and provide minimal visual background stimulation, while the audio has been Sean's opinion on politics or religious events. This will likely be expanded upon in the near future. We have also stated that once the existing back catalogue of Minecraft videos is uploaded, no more will be produced. We have not filmed any new Minecraft videos since January 1, 2018.</p>
	  <p>Ever since the events of June 28, in which Sean and Bri got in a huge fight and four members left, followed on July 14 with the massive departure of Maguire and Nathan, it was obvious the old consensus was finally cracking. While relations between Sean and Bri are now friendly again, and Nosiphus' membership has recovered slightly, Sean still decided more needed to be done. Therefore, on September 4, the plan was set to move in the direction of a worker co-op, and Sean created three new forms and publicized another, two of which were proper complaint forms, something that the company never had before.</p>
	  <p>You can read the entire plan outline here - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZtvfkW5iWMco-ACsEU_tVyN13t6PnRWB8yRhY_GijYk/edit">Nosiphus Change Plans for 2019</a></p>
