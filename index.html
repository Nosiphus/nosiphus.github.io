Several of our members are in Washington DC and will be part of the National Memorial Day Parade.<br /><br />As far as Telkit Development Edition's succession to Telkit, progress has been made. A world seed and generator have been selected, our Sphax PureBDcraft patches have been updated as textures come out, and mods are being updated regularly. The new server is being experimented with, and seems to be working fairly well.<br /><br />If there is something you need to access that is not here yet, visit the <a href="http://june2016.archives.nosiphus.com/">old site.</a></p></div>
