						<b>Recent as of Wednesday, March 3, 2021</b> - Well, it's certainly been a while since the last update was posted. Since last November, a few things have happened. Telkit has been modified quite a bit, and has returned to 1.16.5 on version 10.0. Telkit 10 is also receiving a Sphax PureBDcraft patch collection for its modded textures, although it is taking a while because many textures need to be drawn from scratch.<br><br>
						
						The BSL shader that ships with Telkit and Telkit Legacy has had some slight adjustments made to it. There are a set of default color settings that are delivered alongside it, and we have also made a modification to the shader's block properties to enable support for modded blocks. This includes things like modded leaves and plants now blowing in the wind.<br><br>
						
						The 1.16.5 server is up and running, so you can access it at any time.<br><br>
