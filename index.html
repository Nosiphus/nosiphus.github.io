	  <p>Recent as of Sunday, June 24, 2018 - I would've never thought that we'd have come this far and still be doing it. Today, June 24, marks the fifth anniversary of the day when Wyatt and I loaded up the server for the very first time and began working on the blue HQ of <em>Nosiphus Original Video</em>. To think that half a decade later, we'd have taken the server from a tiny program running on my old laptop and turned it into a 120-mod behemoth with players from across the globe, some who didn't even speak English, would have been monumental and seemingly impossible to the two kids who just wanted to do what their heroes, the Yogscast, did on a daily basis. Wyatt, thank you for helping me build the server up into what it is today, and thank you for helping grow Nosiphus even when we had our differences. And to all our players and members, past and present, thank you for your support and your contributions. Nosiphus wouldn't be the same without you. Most of all, a massive thank you to Notch, whose game has touched all of our lives by allowing this to happen, and thank you for giving joy and a tool for creativity to the millions who play Minecraft.<br>
