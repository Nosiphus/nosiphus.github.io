						<b>Recent as of Thursday, November 19, 2020</b> - With Telkit Development Edition getting closer to be mostly feature-complete, I want to announce the current situation as we begin the transition from 1.12-based Telkit 8 to 1.16-based Telkit 9.<br><br>
						
						Currently, there are only two outstanding mods that MUST be updated before the 1.16 pack takes over the main line. Those two mods are TerraForged and ProjectE. Galacticraft or another space travel mod will be added at a later point in time. Presently, there are no mods available to add space travel to Minecraft 1.16.<br><br>
						
						Buildcraft, IndustrialCraft 2, Forestry, and Thaumcraft will most likely not be making the journey to Telkit 9. The latter three have no 1.13+ builds, and the first is already set to move to Fabric. Telkit will remain with Forge. These mods may join the pack at a later date, perhaps in Telkit 10.<br><br>
						
						So, what is the transition going to be?<br><br>
						
						When the move to 1.12 was completed in June 2018, Telkit 6 took over the main line, and Telkit 5 for 1.7 became Telkit Classic. We will be doing something similar this time. When Telkit 9 releases, Telkit 8 will be moving to another pack which has yet to be named.<br><br>
						
						That being said, the best course of action when the time to update comes will be for users to rename the telkit folder inside their .technic directories to the new 8.x name, so a fresh Telkit 9 will be downloaded.<br><br>
						
						Telkit 9.x will be the last version of Telkit to utilize the 2015 naming conventions. Due to the limit of how many characters can be used in the versioning, we will hit a problem once we're on Telkit 10 and an update needs to be pushed out on a double-digit date of a double-digit months (i.e. 11.19).<br><br>
						
						A completely new versioning scheme is in the planning stages, but at the moment, Telkit 8 is still supported, as all our modpacks are. We are at the mercy of the TerraForged developers, so whenever they make the decision to update their mod to 1.16, Telkit 9 will take over.<br><br>
