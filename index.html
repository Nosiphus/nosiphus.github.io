  			<p>Recent as of Monday, June 24, 2019 - Six years have passed since Monday, June 24, 2013, when the Nosiphus server first ran. Wyatt and I logged in and started building the blue HQ, and eventually it led to <em>Nosiphus Original Video</em>. I'm proud of how far Nosiphus has come since then, but it's also important to remember where we got our start.</p>
			<p>While the original server is lost to time (well, I did recover the server world files, but they're too corrupted to be used), I have worked hard to make, as close as possible, a 1:1 replica of both the original world and the world of <em>Nosiphus Mansion Video</em>. I don't usually run this server, but today, the Nosiphus Required Mods server will be up for everyone to browse a piece of history.</p>
			<p>Go to the Installation Instructions page for details, and install the pack "Nosiphus Required Mods". The IP is preconfigured. For added nostalgia, start the 2013 soundtrack playlist on Spotify, and play it from "Summer Breeze" onwards.
