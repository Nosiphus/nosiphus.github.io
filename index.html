		<p>Recent as of Sunday, July 22, 2018 - We have decided to privatize our modpacks and server due to a multitude of reasons.</p>
		<p><strong>1. Restrictions</strong><br>Privatizing access to the pack frees us from rules governing what can and cannot be in public packs. Most notably of these is OptiFine, which has a flat-no policy when it comes to public modpacks. Sphax PureBDcraft also has rules against public redistribution of the public pack. With privatization, we can add the mod and the resource pack directly into Telkit and also overwrite things we don't like without having to complicate things.</p>
		<p><strong>2. Protection</strong><br>Making the server private access grants us the ability to protect any intellectual property built there, including test designs for possible future projects and products, which is what the server was supposed to be in the first place. It also allows us to keep any sets we do for any videos (although that is likely over) safe from tampering.</p>
		<p>These rules will remain in place unless we write a custom launcher that downloads the mods from their advertised links, which is the only way we could include OptiFine in any public pack.</p>
	  
	  <p>We have a new Discord server available <a href="http://discord.gg/AX6p6Vv">here</a>.</p>
