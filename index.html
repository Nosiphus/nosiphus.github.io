						<b>Recent as of Tuesday, June 2, 2020 - </b>In past years, we have brought June in with a lighthearted reference to the summer of 2013.<br><br>
						
						
						Not this year.<br><br>
						
						
						It was a week ago yesterday that another black man was murdered by a police officer for no reason whatsoever. It is absolutely ridiculous that this keeps happening, and the country has finally decided that cops are not above the law.<br><br>
						
						
						As we are in the process of rebuilding the <span class="red">Labour</span> website, the statements are not posted yet. However, we will be linking to various places where you can donate to the legal defense funds of arrested protestors, and petitions to sign.<br><br>
