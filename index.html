  <p>Recent as of Sunday, February 3, 2019 - Due to the January resurgence of Minecraft's popularity, we here at Nosiphus have been playing modded survival, something we haven't done in a very, very long time. It has been going for long enough that we have considered the Times of Transition to be over, and that a new Third Golden Age has been upon us.</p>
  <p>There's something else as well. This idea has been floating around in the back of Sean's head for a few years now, but now, he is seriously contemplating the return of the Nosiphus Server Network to operation. The Nosiphus Server Network was the multi-server vanilla network that brought the summer 2014 international coalition to prominence. It had a playerbase of around 50-60 users across various time zones. We currently have pages under development to see it return.</p>
  <p>The following servers would exist in the network, * indicating an existing server:<br>Creative Free Build<br>Creative Plots<br>Factions<br>Vanilla Survival<br>Telkit*<br>Nosiphus Required Mods*</p>
  <p>The following servers would also be involved, but remain unconnected to the main network due to version incompatibility:<br>Tekkit Classic*<br>Beta 1.7.3 Server*</p>
