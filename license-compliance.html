		<strong>License Compliance</strong><br><br>
		We are making an effort here at Nosiphus to right the wrongs of our past, and make everything we do that involves content from others compliant with the wishes of others.<br><br>
	<details>
		<summary>Modpack Compliance</summary><br>
		Our modpacks were privated on July 25, 2018, due to their inclusion of the OptiFine mod. This mod is important to ensuring the pack runs well, and we didn't want to fall back into a situation similar to the one in 2015 when users had to modify PureBDcraft before the NosLabs Custom Blocks mod was coded.
		<br><br>
		To make our packs compliant, one of two things would have to happen.
		<br>
		<br>
		Option 1 - sp614x changes his mind and lifts the rules governing public modpack inclusion.
		<br>
		<br>
		Option 2 - We write a custom launcher that opens a browser window and has the user download OptiFine from the adf.ly links. We would need to also make it auto-run the OptiFine installer to extract the mod file. We have wanted to write a custom launcher for our packs for a long time, and have it look similar to the old Technic Pack launcher from early 2012. We are unsure of where to start, so if someone could point us in the correct direction, it would be much appreciated.

		<summary>Resource Pack Compliance</summary>
			Ever since Wyatt introduced Sean to it in July 2013, Sphax PureBDcraft has become the go-to resource pack we use. However, until June 1, 2018, we often did things that were against the license of the patch, and ever since that day, we've been working to make things compliant.
		<br>
		<br>
			We removed any base pack textures from our modpack patches, notably for Telkit Classic. We're also working towards converting some of our older modifications, notably to the VoxelBox Modern back in 2013. The trouble there is that TheVoxelBox Modern is also in violation of the PureBDcraft license, and that wasn't our fault. Sean has notified HanFox of the BDcraft forums and will comply with anything HanFox tells him to do.
