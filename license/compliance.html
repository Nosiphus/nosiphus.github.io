<p><strong>License Compliance</strong><br>
  <br>
  We are making an effort here at Nosiphus to right the wrongs of our past, and make everything we do that involves content from others compliant with the wishes of others.<br>

  <summary>Modpack Compliance</summary>
  <br>
  Our modpacks were privated on July 25, 2018, due to their inclusion of the OptiFine mod. This mod is important to ensuring the pack runs well, and we didn't want to fall back into a situation similar to the one in 2015 when users had to modify PureBDcraft before the NosLabs Custom Blocks mod was coded.<br><br>
  Initially, we were trying to figure out a way to keep the mod's functions in the pack without violating the rules it had, and we tried various options. First, we added MCPatcher to our older packs as an attempt to restore that, but MCPatcher is terrible. Then, we tried writing our own custom launcher that would download everything, but that ended up being way too difficult.<br><br>
  Then, we had another idea, something so simple that it was completely overlooked. Sean coded a tiny mod called OptiFinder, and it had one single purpose: make sure that the mods folder contained the correct version of OptiFine. This little mod searches the mods directory, and if it doesn't find the OptiFine JAR, then it opens a dialog box as well the download page, and it also blocks the pack's usage, making OptiFine an essential requirement for the modpack. This allows sp614x to collect all the revenue he would normally earn from the standard OptiFine links, and it allows us to force our users to install the mod.<br><br>
  Presently, OptiFinder only works with Minecraft 1.12.2, but it will be backported to all previous Nosiphus modpacks, including the usually overlooked Nosiphus Unleashed.

  <summary>Resource Pack Compliance</summary>
  <br>
  Ever since Wyatt introduced Sean to it in July 2013, Sphax PureBDcraft has become the go-to resource pack we use. However, until June 1, 2018, we often did things that were against the license of the patch, and ever since that day, we've been working to make things compliant. <br>
  <br>
  We removed any base pack textures from our modpack patches, notably for Telkit Classic. We're also working towards converting some of our older modifications from license violations to legal texture overrides. One pack, however, that we have issues with is TheVoxelBox Modern. While under the rules of TheVoxelBox, re-hosting is not a violation of their rules, the texture pack in question includes textures from the Sphax PureBDcraft patch, and since there is a BDcraft texture in the pack, it cannot be redistributed. Sean is regularly conversing with HanFox, the lead moderator of the BDcraft forums on resolving licensing issues across the board.
