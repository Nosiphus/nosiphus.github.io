	<p><b>General</b><br> <br>Q: What is Nosiphus?<br><b>A: Nosiphus is a software company that also happens to have hardware ideas. Design is key here, and as we reset ourselves to what we set out to be, more and more designs are due to come in.</b><br> <br>Q: Can I join Nosiphus?<br><b>A: Right now, the only way to join is be invited.</b></p>
	
	<p><br><b>Saturn</b><br> <br>Q: What is Saturn?<br><b>A: Saturn is an operating system. It was conceived in 2011 as a concept system, but has only ever existed in the computer world as a customized openSUSE Linux distribution. We plan to write the operating system from the ground up.</b><br> <br>Q: What is Saturn's primary focus?<br><b>A: In the long run, our intention is for Saturn to be an entirely new codebase free of ancient jargon. The trobule with macOS is that it's not customizable, Windows is plagued by security problems and ancient compatiblity features, and if you don't know what you're doing you really shouldn't be using Linux.</b></p>

	  <strong>Minecraft</strong><br>
	  &nbsp;<br>
	  Q: What is Minecraft?<br>
	  <strong>A: Have you just discovered the Internet? <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft">Read This.</a></strong><br>
	  &nbsp;<br>
	  Q: What is Telkit?<br>
	  <strong>A: Telkit is our modpack. It powers the Nosiphus Modded Server.</strong><br>
	  &nbsp;<br>
	  Q: What is NosPack/are the Nosiphus Required Mods/is the Nosiphus Pack o' Fun?<br>
	  <strong>A: These are older packs that once powered the Nosiphus Modded Server when it ran on previous versions of Minecraft, 1.6.4 and 1.5.2 specifically. The Pack o' Fun never ran a server, but was thrown together for 1.4.7.</strong><br>
	  &nbsp;<br>
	  Q: Can I join the Nosiphus Modded Server?<br>
	  <strong>A: We would prefer to have the server be open arms to everyone, but due to license rules surrounding OptiFine, the modpack is privatized. That being said, if you somehow get ahold of the pack, we have no issue with you playing on the server.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>There are two ways to get around this, one is for sp614x to lift the rule banning OptiFine from public packs, the other way is for us to write a custom launcher that would pull up the advertised link to OptiFine's download. We really want a custom launcher, but we don't know where to start.<br>

	  &nbsp;<br>
