        1. Download and install the version of Java that your system uses: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/htj4khqefb3r8ym/jre-8u172-windows-x64.exe">Windows</a> - <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/pf30657845gv3yn/jre-8u172-macosx-x64.dmg">macOS</a> - <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/gk6ebf8af4n6vkw/jre-8u172-linux-i586.rpm">Linux</a><br><br>
        2. Download the version of the Technic Launcher that runs on your system (downloads at bottom of page): <a href="http://www.technicpack.net/download">Technic Launcher</a><br><br>

        5. Click the Modpacks tab, and then click Launcher Options, then Java Arguments.<br><br>
        6. Look at the RAM listings available. If your computer's maximum setting is 3.5GB, go with that. If your maximum setting is 7GB, go 4GB. If your maximum setting is 16GB, go 12GB. After setting the value, exit out of the options box.<br><br>
        7. Type in the name of the modpack you wish to use. As of this being written, the only Nosiphus pack that is public is Telkit, as the others are not yet license compliant with OptiFine. This will change as time goes on. After selecting a pack, click Install, and then click Play.<br><br>
