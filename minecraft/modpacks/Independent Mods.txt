Hello, nCraft users!
Do you have a mod you like to use alongside the rest of your chosen modpack, but that mod isn't in the pack, so it gets deleted when updates roll around?
Well, we have a solution, called the "usermods" folder.

The usermods folder is specifically meant for mods that the user wants to run in the pack that the modpack doesn't have in it.
For example, let's say you want to run Dynamic Lights or OptiFine in a modpack that doesn't have those mods installed.

You can download those mods by yourself, put them into the usermods folder, and the pack will run them when launched.
The modpack, whenever updates come around, will not change the contents of the usermods folder, meaning you won't have to reinstall those mods when the pack updates.

However, there are two drawbacks. You'll have to keep track of these mods being updated by yourself.
It also means that if the modpack authors add that mod to their pack, nCraft won't auto-remove that mod from your usermods folder.
