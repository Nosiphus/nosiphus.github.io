Hello there, nCraft modpack authors! This document was created to help explain the layout of our modpack download system.
Presently, the launcher is under construction, but it is able to download files now. Here's how to lay your update files out.

id=telkit - This is the spaceless, all-lowercase ID of your modpack. Spaces and characters are to be represented by dashes, like this: "telkit-classic".
name=Telkit - This is the proper name for the pack, including capitalization, spaces, and non-alphanumerical characters.
author=Nosiphus - This is where you put you or your organization's name, and with proper formatting.
minecraft=1.12.2 - This indicates the version of Minecraft that your pack is designed for.
version=6.6.0 - This is where you place the version identifier. The file should also be named like this, i.e. "6.6.0.txt".
date=10.20.2018 - This is where you place the date the update was released. It is in US format of Month-Date-Year.
requiredram=6144 - You can specify a minimum amount of RAM, in megabytes, the pack needs to run.

Next, you will place the directory structure. While not required, we recommend you store the base folder first, then prioritize by subfolder.

An important thing to note is the prefix before the http header, for example, n: or w:. These have specific functions.

n: tells nCraft that this link is to be treated like a normal link, and the launcher should directly download from the link.
w: tells nCraft that this link is not a direct download link, and will open the user's browser to download the mod in question.
