Hello there, nCraft modpack authors! This document was created to help explain the layout of our modpack download system.
Now, presently, the launcher does not exist, but setting this system up on the Nosiphus website will be critical for it to function.

So, each file will have a modpack header, as demonstrated here:

id="telkit" - This is the spaceless, all-lowercase ID of your modpack. Spaces and characters are to be represented by dashes, like this: "telkit-classic".
name="Telkit" - This is the proper name for the pack, including capitalization, spaces, and non-alphanumerical characters.
author="Nosiphus" - This is where you put you or your organization's name, and with proper formatting.
minecraft="1.12.2" - This indicates the version of Minecraft that your pack is designed for.
version="6.6.0" - This is where you place the version identifier. The file should also be named like this, i.e. "6.6.0.txt".
date="10.20.2018" - This is where you place the date the update was released. It is in US format of Month-Date-Year.

Next, you will place the directory structure and any special commands for each directory.
-c indicates client-only mods.
-s indicates server-only mods.
-u indicates universal mods.
Sometimes, however, mods cannot be directly downloaded from their servers, either due to webpage authorization or the download not being the JAR on its own.
-w will direct the launcher to open your browser to download the mod.
-m allows you to add specific instructions on what to do. This is useful when it comes to adf.ly confusing non-tech savvy users.
-z indicates the download is a zip file with multiple directories. This is noted in modern versions of Flan's Mod.
-r will tell the launcher to rename a file, notably renaming the Forge download to modpack.jar.

Directory layouts are as follows:
Folders should be in alphabetical order, and in the order of client, server, and then universal, like this. Subfolders take priority.
/
/bin
/mods/1.12.2 -c
/mods/1.12.2 -u
/mods -c
/mods -c -w
/mods -s
/mods -u
/mods -u -w

/ -u -z -> This tells the launcher that the next few mods are universal mods that need to be extracted in the root folder.
flansmod="https://drive.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=1dHmi_5Hu97Uk7WLOnIi-biQEP-z8wWvT&export=download"
The mod has a short ID in front. This format should not contain spaces unless it's for modules, for example:
opencomputers, not open-computers
projectred-world, not projectredworld or project-red-world
After that, there is an equal sign, then a link inside quotation marks.

/mods/1.12.2 -u -> This tells the pack that there is a specific subfolder where certain universal mods must go.
chickenasm="http://chickenbones.net/maven/codechicken/ChickenASM/1.12-1.0.2.7/ChickenASM-1.12-1.0.2.7.jar"

/mods -c -w -> This tells the launcher that there are client-side mods that have to be downloaded from a webpage, like so:
optifine="https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_E2.jar" -m="Click Download OptiFine_1.12.2...., then run the file, and extract to the Telkit mods directory."
The -m tells the launcher to give the users instructions on how to download and install the mod.
