	<p>So, if you've been looking around the site's GitHub directories, you might've seen the name "nCraft" popping up in a few places. However, we haven't really given a public explanation for what this is, so we will elaborate here.</p>
    
    <p>nCraft will be our custom modpack launcher. While the program does not exist in any form at the moment, we want to start development and get it ready to go over the course of 2019.</p>
    
    <p>nCraft will operate completely differently than most modpack launchers do. Technic, for instance, operates from either single zip downloads or from its TechnicSolder program. Solder, however, requires an independent server. Curse also depends on its massive backend infrastructure and update system. ATLauncher pre-approves all packs published.</p>
    
    <p>nCraft will use a textfile-based update system that will contain specific arguments that the launcher and not backend servers will interpret. Mods will be downloaded straight from their servers instead of from ZIP files. For mods that require webpage authorization, the launcher will open the webpage in question and give instructions to the user.</p>
