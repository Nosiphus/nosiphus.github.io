ONE OF THESE MINES -

One of these mines
One of these crazy old mines
We gonna find out, pretty miner, what turns on your lights
The server is lagging, my framerates aren't high
And my graphics card whispers and moans
You've got your frame lag and you've got bad drivers
Well I've got a few of my own

Oooh, someone to complain to
In between the crash and the spike
Oooh, comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these mines <- needs rewritten

One of these memes
One of these dank and epic memes, now
We gonna find one, oooh, one that really streams
I've been searching for the diamonds of the devil himself
I've been searching for some gold in the light
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both <- original lyric
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight <- original lyric

Oooh, lagginess will blind you
In between the sword and the strike
Oooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these mines
