		<p><strong>Tekkit To The Limit</strong><br>by <a href="/nosiphites/sean-crain.html">Sean Crain</a><br>Written in April 2015<br>A parody of Take It To The Limit by Eagles</p>
	
		<p>Looking over for some rubber trees<br>When the sunlight has faded to moon<br>I was hoping for some copper that I needed<br>Once in a blue moon</p>
		
		<p>You know I've always been a miner<br>(Spend my nights digging down)<br>And it's too dark to see<br>(Can't seem to turn around)<br>But the mines I've seen lately<br>Keep on digging out and mining out<br>And digging out the same</p>
		
		<p>So give me a modpack<br>And don't let me die<br>And Tekkit to the Limit one more time</p>
		
		<p>You can spend all your stuff on BuildCraft<br>You can spend all your ores for IC2<br>If RedPower crashed the server tomorrow<br>Would you use EE2?</p>
		
		<p>And when you're looking for some diamonds<br>(Everyone has been there)<br>And it's getting too cold<br>(Seems the mine is all but bare)<br>When there's nothing worth taking<br>Still you look more, looking more<br>You keep looking for gold</p>
		
		<p>So give me a modpack<br>And don't let me die<br>And Tekkit to the Limit one more time</p>
		
		<p>Tekkit to the Limit<br>Tekkit to the Limit<br>Tekkit to the Limit one more time</p>
