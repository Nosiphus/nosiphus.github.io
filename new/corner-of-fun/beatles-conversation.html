						<b>A Conversation of Beatles #1s</b><br><br>
						
						Billy Shears: <b>Hey Jude</b>, <b>Eleanor Rigby</b> told me that she has <b>Something</b> to say to you.<br>
						
						Jude: She wants us to <b>Come Together</b>? Truth be told, <b>I Feel Fine</b> on my own.<br>
						
						Billy Shears: I talked to her <b>Yesterday</b>. It's clear that <b>She Loves You</b>.<br>
						
						Jude: I've been down <b>The Long and Winding Road</b> with her. <b>Eight Days A Week</b>, I had <b>A Hard Day's Night</b>. I guess <b>We Can Work It Out</b> if we give it a try.<br>
						
						Billy Shears: <b>From Me To You</b>, she's definitely better for you than <b>Lady Madonna</b> ever could have hoped to have been. That woman was a <b>Day Tripper</b>.<br>
						
						Jude: No arguing about that. She's had a <b>Ticket To Ride</b> for a while now. She may be try to buy a lot of things, but she <b>Can't Buy Me Love</b>.<br>
						
						Billy Shears: Hey, <b>All You Need Is Love</b>. So, what have you been up to lately anyway? Aren't you a <b>Paperback Writer</b> now?<br>
						
						Jude: Yes, I am. <b>Let It Be</b> known that I was the one who wrote that story about <b>The Ballad of John and Yoko</b>.<br>
						
						Billy Shears: You wrote that? I have to say, it was really good. Where are you living at the moment?<br>
						
						Jude: I've bought a house on <b>Penny Lane</b>. It looks like a <b>Yellow Submarine</b> on the inside. I haven't finished moving yet.<br>
						
						Billy Shears: Do you need any <b>Help</b> moving your stuff?<br>
						
						Jude: Yes, it would be much appreciated. I'm going to run ahead to the new place and get some things ready.<br>
						
						Billy Shears: Alright, I'll <b>Get Back</b> to you in about half an hour.<br>
						
						Eleanor Rigby: <b>Hello, Goodbye</b>.<br>
						
						Jude: Billy told me about what you said to him. Is it true?<br>
						
						Eleanor Rigby: Yes, Jude. I know this is rather quick, but<b>I Want To Hold Your Hand</b>. May I?<br>
						
						Jude: Of course. Come on, we gotta get to my new place so Billy can help me start moving.<br>
						
						Eleanor Rigby: Let's go then. As long as you <b>Love Me Do</b>, I don't care where we go.
