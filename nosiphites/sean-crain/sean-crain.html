    <strong>Jackson's Comment</strong><br>
    He is a sexist, white, male pig.</p>
  <p><strong>Political Positions</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Abortion:</strong> I am fully pro-choice, but I also believe that we can reduce the number of abortions through comprehensive sex education as well as distributing condoms to high schoolers. We should also have birth control and contraceptives as a direct part of the healthcare system.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Affirmative Action:</strong> I fully support affirmative action programs.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Antitrust:</strong> I support the strengthening and the enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. We should break up the existing banks, media companies, oil companies, telecommunications companies, and online retailers that have consolidated their control of informations and necessities.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Banks:</strong> The Glass-Steagall provisions of the Banking Act of 1933 should be restored, and the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation should remain in effect. We should also revitalize our postal system by introducing a government-operated basic banking system at the post offices.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Borders:</strong> What the Trump administration is doing with the separation of children from their parents is a damaging, traumatic thing to do to people who've already had to escape horrible conditions in other countries. We should end this barbarism, abolish ICE, and consider all nonviolent immigrants candidates for U.S. citizenship.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Capital Gains Tax:</strong> We should abolish the capital gains tax and tax capital gains under regular income brackets.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Civil Rights:</strong> I support amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the already codified protections of race, color, sex, national origin, and religion. Other civil rights legislation should be reworded to directly reference the protected provisions of the Civil Rights Act.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Climate Change:</strong> None of these other positions will be relevant if we do not directly combat climate change. A carbon tax should be implemented, we should convert to a 100% green economy by 2050, we should convert all cars to be fully electric, and we should leave fossil fuels in the ground. We should also make a worldwide public relations effort to encourage all people to have fewer children to reduce the world's population to around a billion over the next couple of centuries.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Corporate Tax:</strong> Corporate taxes should be reworked to be the same as regular income taxes, but the thresholds should be multiplied by 10, considering that corporations earn far more money and have more to manage. In addition to this, shareholder dividends would also be taxed under regular income rates. Small businesses would be taxed under regular income rates. Businesses could receive tax credits for investing in improvements, job creation, and employing U.S. workers. They would receive tax penalties for Wall Street speculation, outsourcing, and undercutting costs to raise executive salaries.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Criminal Punishment:</strong> We should adopt the Nordic model of rehabilitation rather than tough-on-crime punishment. We should also release nonviolent drug offenders and treat drug abuse as a public health issue instead of a criminal justice issue.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Death Penalty:</strong> The death penalty is a barbaric practice that no civilized nation should have in its code of law. It should be abolished for all offenses.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Defense:</strong> The military is massively overbloated and imperialistic. We should restore Carter-era military spending adjusted for inflation and downsize the military to something manageable. We should withdraw from the Middle East and equally support Israel and Palestine. We should make the two nations recognize the 1967 United Nations border.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Education:</strong> No Child Left Behind should be repealed and standardized testing needs to be abolished. We need to appoint a board of teachers, principals, school superintendents, and school board members to oversee a massive reorganization of the public education system. We should increase teacher salaries and also end school vouchers and put a permanent stop to the teaching of creationism in science classrooms. It is not science and never was. I also believe that the monopoly that the CollegeBoard holds over accelerated courses should be broken up, and both the SAT and ACT should be forced out of the market. Private companies do not belong in the public education system. College should also be free and paid for by a 50% tax on the speculative acts of Wall Street. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Energy:</strong> The energy sector should be nationalized. We should be converted to a 100% green economy by the year 2050. New buildings should be constructed with solar panels built in and the modular air conditioning systems of Europe should be utilized.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Federation:</strong> I support the separate levels of power in local, state, and federal governments.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Healthcare:</strong> This is the richest country in the history of the world. Every other industrialized country is able to provide single-payer healthcare to their populations. We can expand Medicare to all people and massively cut down on administrative costs, and then end private health insurance permanently.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Income Tax:</strong> I support the restoration of inflation-adjusted Eisenhower-era tax rates.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> This country's infrastructure hasn't had a massive overhaul since the New Deal in the 1930s and the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. We should spend a trillion dollars rebuilding the infrastructure of this nation while simulatenously transferring the energy grid away from fossil fuels.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Inheritance Tax:</strong> I support a progressive inheritance tax that culminates in a 100% tax on all $5 million+ amounts.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Military Intervention:</strong> The United States should adopt a non-interventionist foreign policy and stay out of all wars that do not directly threaten our national security.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Monetary System:</strong> The Bretton Wood system of monetary management should be restored and the government should restore the dollar to the gold standard.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Net neutrality:</strong> Congress should enshrine net neutrality into the United States Code and enforce net neutrality protections. The corporate telcom monopolies should be broken up and be forbidden from owning content.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Social Security:</strong> We should lift the cap on taxable earnings. Someone making $1,000,000 shouldn't be paying the same rate as someone who is making $118,000.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>State surveillance:</strong> The National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security should be abolished. The Patriot Act should be fully repealed and the Fourth Amendment should be enforced. State-sanctioned wiretapping and monitoring is unconstitutional and dangerous.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Tax loopholes:</strong> People and corporations should be forbidden from storing wealth in offshore tax loopholes. Loopholes should be closed for new wealth. Existing wealth stored offshore would be treated as bootlegged cargo and would be subjected to massive import tariffs on top of the tax rate it would have been subjected to.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Trade:</strong> I support the withdrawal of the United States from NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China, and adopt a policy of only allowing free trade with nations that have roughly the same environmental, labor, and wage regulations as enforced here. The reintroduction of the Hamiltonian tariff system would also occur. We would also encourage other nations to adopt protectionist policies themselves, forcing multinational corporations to employ people within their home nations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Trade Unions:</strong> I am a firm believer in trade unionism. Right-to-work laws should be dismantled, unions should be allowed to organize, and there should be a system in place for unions to directly report corporate mistreatment to the government. The government would also encourage the formation of worker co-ops and the end of massive CEO payouts.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>War crimes:</strong> The United States cannot claim to be the arsenal of democracy when it harbors war criminals within its borders. George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and other high-level Bush adminstration officials should be put on trial for war crimes committed in Iraq. Henry Kissinger would also be sent to the Hague. We would also encourage the UK Government to prosecute Tony Blair and the high-ranking officials of the 1997-2010 Labour government who also had cards to play in Iraq.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Women:</strong> In addition to abortion, I support full pay equity for women through strengthening of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. </p>
