					<b>Video Classification Rationale</b><br><br>
					Due to YouTube's COPPA compliance enforcements, we have decided to add rationales to each of our video descriptions to explain why each video has been classified in the way it has. These are the standard rationale clauses we use.<br><br>
					
					Use each clause in the following format:<br>
					RATIONALE FOR BEING MARKED AS "FOR KIDS/NOT FOR KIDS":<br>
					Target audience: All ages/13+/18+<br>
					Clause<br>
					Another Clause if needed
				</p>

						<b>CLAUSES</b><br><br>

						This video contains language that parents might find objectionable for children.<br>
						This video was recorded before the presenter was 13, but was uploaded afterwards for the presenter's friends.<br>
						This video was recorded before the presenter was 13, and was specifically meant for the presenter's peers at the time.<br>
						This video was uploaded after the presenter was 13.<br>
