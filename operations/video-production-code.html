						<b>Video Production Code</b><br><br>
						
						
						These are our guidelines for video production.<br><br>
						
						<b><span class="red">DO NOT DELETE THE ORIGINAL RECORDING AFTER THE EDITED VERSION HAS BEEN MADE.</span></b>
					
					</p>
					
					<div class="p">
						
						<p>
					
							<b>Content Guidelines</b><br><br>
							
							
							You must follow all of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/#community-guidelines">YouTube's Community Guidelines</a>.<br><br>
							
							
							We will allow you to swear in videos, provided that it does not become an excessive problem.<br><br>
							
							
							Derogatory language of any kind is prohibited in all circumstances.<br><br>
							
							
							We do want to encourage debate in our political and religious commentary videos, but do not turn a civilized debate into a shouting match.<br><br>
							
							
							If you are disputing another's viewpoint, you must restrain your criticism to that of the belief itself, and not the person who holds that belief.<br><br>
							
							
							Offensive jokes do not belong on the Nosiphus YouTube channel. We will be altering many of our past videos because of this.<br><br>
							
							
							If YouTube pulls a video you made and issues the Nosiphus channel with a community guidelines strike, we will enact a suspension on your video uploading privileges.

							<b>Editing Code</b><br><br>
							
							
							<b>1. Videos should have an introductory theme song.</b><br><br>
							
							Do not use a copyrighted audio track if Nosiphus has not licensed it.<br>
							
							A good source for royalty-free audio tracks is <a href="https://incompetech.com/">Incompetech</a>.<br><br>
							
							All audio tracks should be played at -10 dB compared to the main audio track. Intros and outros should run for no longer than thirty seconds.<br>
							
							The intro should have an exponential fade starting at the twentieth second.<br>
							
							The outro should have a constant gain ending at the tenth second.<br><br>
							
							
							<b>2. Any edits made should follow the content guidelines.</b><br><br>
							
							
							<b>3. The video's description should look like the following block of text.</b>

							<b>Production</b>
						
						</p>
						
						<div class="p">
						
							<p>
							
								<b>Computer Games</b><br><br>
								
								
								1. Record your videos with your graphics card software's built-in recording software. These are called NVIDIA Share and AMD Radeon.<br>
								
								2. If possible, record your microphone audio track separately from your system audio so it can be isolated if needed.<br>
								
								3. Disable all copyrighted in-game music unless that music has been licensed by us for use.
							
							</p>
						
						</div>
						
						<div class="p">
						
							<p>
							
								<b>Music</b><br><br>
								
								
								1. DO NOT USE COPYRIGHTED AUDIO TRACKS. This could result in the loss of monetization, or worse, a copyright strike.<br>
								
								2. If you only have audio available, the video should be a photo or album art that you have created for the track.<br>
								
								3. Music videos do not follow Section 1 of the Editing Code as having intro and outro music would ruin the point.
							
							</p>
						
						</div>
						
						<div class="p">
						
							<p>
							
								<b>News</b><br><br>
								
								
								1. If you are presenting the news on its own, then you try to remain as neutral as possible on the subject matter at hand. If you have a particular take on that story, it should be added after you have finished telling the main story.
							
							</p>
						
						</div>
						
						<div class="p">
						
							<p>
							
								<b>Politics and Religion</b><br><br>
								
								
								1. Biases are acceptable, but the video and description should have a disclaimer that you hold certain biases.<br>
								
								2. Discussions should not escalate into a yelling contest. Try to keep debates as reasonable as possible.
							
							</p>
						
						</div>
						
						<div class="p">
						
							<p>
							
								<b>Real-Life</b><br><br>
								
								
								1. Film all videos in a 16:9 or greater horizontal format. Avoid vertical videos.<br>
								
								2. Film from multiple perspectives if possible.
								
								3. If the real-life video you are producing is a vlog and you have made your own blog alongside it, the only requirement is that you adhere to the content guidelines and have the Nosiphus logo present at the top of the blog.
