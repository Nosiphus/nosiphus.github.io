    <p><b>What Should the Democratic Party Be?</b><br>Sean Atchinson - September 20, 2018</p>
<p>Note: Atchinson wrote this before September 20, 2018, but we don't have the original date. The date given is the digitization date.</p>
    <p>Democrats have a unique opportunity in this moment. Dems have an opportunity to transform and reinvigorate their party. The question many of us face is: How? How do you transform a party which still has many people who think everything is fine? How do you transform a party that still answers to corporate America rather than working class America? How do we get elected officials who are not paid off by a bigger agenda?<br>
      <br>
      The answer is complicated. A complicated answer with a big to-do list.<br>
      <br>
      First, Democrats have to invest themselves in their party. I am not talking about people who are to vote "likely Democratic" every election. I am talking about people who bleed blue. People who have devoted their political engagement to the Democratic Party. Those blue-blooded Democrats have to say enough is enough and take their party back from the leaders they have elected. Leaders, which I remind you, oversaw the greatest election losses by the Democratic Party ever. These leaders have to be replaced with new blood, by people who have purpose and drive. These blue-blooded Democrats also have to commit themselves to electing people suited with a progressive agenda which will help everyone, and are willing to compromise.<br>
      <br>
      Second, Democrats HAVE to make inroads into traditionally red states. Democrats will NEVER have a sixty vote majority in the Senate or a safe majority in the House without taking back control in red states. Democrats should target people in states like Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Missouri, and ESPECIALLY Texas. Democrats must pour resources into these states. For example, Mississippi has the highest percentage of African Americans making up its population than any other state in the Union. There is no reason for Democrats to not be able to elect another person of color to Congress over the next ten years. Texas is a growing state for progressives and POC. Within the next decade, we can flip Texas. I mention states like Alabama and Oklahoma because even though it will take a lifetime for a Democrat to win their electoral votes according to pundits, we must remember that these are states that have had 100% Republican control over the last decade and their lives still aren't better. We can't forget any state, county, territory, or municipality.<br>
      <br>
      Third, Democrats have to invest in regular people. Take control of the narrative. Democratic candidates should be seen roaming the streets talking to people as well as going to people's homes and talking to them about the issues affecting them. Local Democratic Parties should conduct concerts and festivals which have activities specific to the population. Many suggest that when there is a popular presidential candidate, those down the ballot do better. Don't get me wrong, they do. Down-the-ballot races do much better when the presidential candidate has a landslide victory. However, the third step considers another possibility: candidates at the top benefit from candidates at the bottom: a trickle-up of votes. Use local candidates who have personal ties to their communities to campaign for people up the ballot. However, this only works if down-the-ballot candidates are willing to do the work. Progressives have to make sure they are electing candidates willing to do the whole job.<br>
      <br>
      Fourth, Democrats have to run on everything. When I say everything, I mean everything. We should say, "We are going to provide healthcare to everyone because we believe no one should die because they cannot afford to go to the doctor." We should say, "There is no reason for the mass numbers of POC living in jail because of drugs and nonviolent crimes. They should be released, a marijuana should be legalized." We should say, "We are going to protect the environment so there is a world for the next generation to make better." We should say, "We are going to expand the role of democracies around the world. We are going to fight tyranny and injustice everywhere because injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." We should say, "We are going to overturn <em>Citizens United</em> and give the republic back to the people."<br>
      <br>
      Just looking at these points, one might say, "that's easy." It will not be easy. It will be hard and new. It will be changing the very fabric of how the Democratic Party functions. It is going to require hard, challenging, calculated work. However, if we succeed, it will be the greatest achievement of our lifetimes.</p>
