    <p><b>Shithole Countries</b><br>Sean Crain - January 14, 2018</p>
    <p>Trump forgot to mention that the United States is one of the shithole countries. Our infrastructure is in disrepair, we have people living in the streets whilst working three jobs, we have starving children and elders, and we don't provide national healthcare. We have a heavily militarized police force and a fascistic custom of having children recite a pledge every morning. Parts of this country look like third world nations. I know it's beyond him, but maybe he should look at his own country before he criticizes others'.</p>
