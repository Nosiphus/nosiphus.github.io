    <p><b>Statement about Syria</b><br>Sean Crain - April 16, 2018</p>
    <p>This is unforgiveable. For his entire presidency, Donald Trump has been able to say that he, unlike George W. Bush, is not a war criminal. And that was the one thing that kept him from being on par with Bush: he hadn't started an illegal war. That changed Friday night.<br><br>The decision to bomb Syria knowing that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was going to begin its investigation the following day, and the decision to not seek a United Nations resolution authorizing military forces constitutes a war crime.<br><br>The situation in Syria is one of the most perilous in modern day affairs. The disasters in the middle east began in 2003 when we illegally toppled Saddam Hussein in order to exploit the region for oil profits. We say we're on the side of the rebels in Syria, yet the truth of the matter is there is no true rebel force left in the region. What is left are several Islamic fundamentalist groups that are in opposition to the Syrian government. We continue to fight the Syrian government, so we prop up Islamic fundamentalists in the region.<br><br>The truth is that the military-industrial complex doesn't actually care about the situation in Syria as far as Syria goes. What's really happening is that the powers that be are more concerned about the fact that they did not get the chance to take the fight to the communist Soviet Union during the Cold War, and they continue to fight proxy wars with the Russians to feed the war machine.<br><br>If Trump wanted to be a real leader, he needs to go with his original intentions and withdraw the United States Armed Forces from the middle east, and be brave enough to cut ties with foreign nations that have horrible human rights abuses.</p>
