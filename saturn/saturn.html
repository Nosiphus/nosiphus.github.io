	<p>Conceptualized on November 22, 2011, Saturn was initially thought of as an early prototype of an operating system. Nosiphus was set up around Saturn. The Minecraft server was launched to be an early prototype of what we wanted Nosiphus to become in the future.</p>

	<p>We have decided that we are going to write the system this time, instead of cloning openSUSE and putting our branding on it.</p>

	<p><b>The Original Saturn</b><br />I recently found a copy of the openSUSE 13.1 distribution that was branded as Saturn 2013. Whilst we have no intentions of having the new Saturn be based on Linux, it does provide a bit of our past.</p>
