	<p>Voyager is planned to be the default web browser within Saturn. It was abandoned whenever the Saturn project fell apart in 2014, but now that computer application development is back at the heart of Nosiphus, it is planned to be rewritten and released.</p>

	<p>Voyager will be available on Saturn, Windows, macOS, and Linux when its development is completed. It will NOT be an extension of the original Voyager program written in March 2013.</p>
	
	<p><b>The Original Voyager</b><br />Voyager is a very, very simple program that was made in about an hour back in March 2013. It is completely dependent on Internet Explorer's Trident engine.</p>
