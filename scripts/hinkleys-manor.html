						<b>SYNOPSIS</b><br><br>
						
						In late January 2016, I had been getting into suspense films and things like The Twilight Zone. On February 7, 2016, the day before Wyatt left Nosiphus for his seven-month hiatus, I wrote out a short story that would've initially had Wyatt and Nathan in it. When Wyatt left the following day, I replaced him with Maguire. I continued to write out more story, and it changed from a short story into a full-length script for a potential film. By 2017, Nathan and I were the lead actors, and I gave the characters proper names.<br><br>
						
						Many people helped add elements to the story. Nate and Jason added stuff, Nathan wrote some of his own material in, and my father even contributed by writing another portion. I wrote the majority of the story and have refined some of their material to fit the overall aesthetic, but it's generally all there.<br><br>
						
						In late December 2016, I set up a Telkit server with the mansion built, and everyone generally pitched in and helped build large portions. Wyatt, notably, decorated the kitchen. Nate built the bedroom, and Nathan helped fill in the floors. I worked on the shell and the basement. Maguire also pitched in at one point.<br><br>
						
						<i>Hinkley's Manor</i> is not done, as the ending needs to be completed, and after that, I will do another revision and edit, but once it is done, we plan to film the production, and I may novelize it.
