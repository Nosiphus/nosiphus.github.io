			<p><b>SYPNOSIS</b></p>
			<p>On March 11, 2017, I sat down to write about my life. Due to emotional reasons described at the very end of the story, I decided that the only way I can truly describe the situation is to just talk about the whole thing. All the way back to the beginning.<br><br>
			This is not in a script form, nor is it an essay. It is a heartfelt recollection of both my current thoughts and archival events and feelings.<br><br>
			It is deeply emotional, and if there are any inaccuracies, I will correct them. I can only state what I can remember, and for the early events, that's not easy.<br><br>
